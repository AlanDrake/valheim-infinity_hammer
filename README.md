## Building

- Copy existing pieces with their contents.
- Quality of life: Extended range, no resource costs, no item drops, no visual effects.
- Precise placement (offset + freeze).
- Remove build restrictions.
- Unbreakable structures.
- Undo/redo system.

See [hammer.md](hammer.md) for more information.

## Blueprints

## Tools

- Add console commands to the build menu.

- Precise terrain changes.

See [tools.md](tools.md) for more information.

### Key bindings

Some commonly used features have pre-made key binds in the configuration. Internally these use the `bind` command.

If you don't wish to use this system you can set all binds to none and make your own bindings with the `bind` command.

Some mouse wheel binds can't be unbound. In this case, set them some unused key combination.
